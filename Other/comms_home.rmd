# $\first{Fundamentals}$

### $\second{Why Storytelling}$

*Data story telling is the practice of building a narrative around a set of data and its accompanying visualizations to help convey the meaning of that data in a powerful and compelling fashion.*

* Focuses attention
* Provides meaning and context
* Helps retain insights 
* Persuades change-resistant stakeholders
* Communicates to non-technical stakeholders

### $\second{Elements}$

#### $\third{- Data}$

Selecting the right data implies including enough contextual insights in a story to better support the main point without overloading with information. Data professionals care about their methods, but the audience likely cares more about results and implications.

When translating technical language consider:

* What does the audience know?
* What do they need to understand? 

Focus on the relevant, reliable, and actionable results (e.g., predictions) and findings (e.g., data analysis).

<br>

#### $\third{- Narrative}$

Make the story compelling and easy to understand. Prioritize the essential points: avoid disconnected facts and focus on central insight in a linear fashion. Keep the focus on action. 

**Background**

* What motivated the analysis?
* What changed?
* Who is the focus of the analysis?

**Insights**

* What contributed to the problem?
* Provide supporting evidence

**Climax**

* What would happen if there is no change?
* What are potential solutions and next steps?

<br>

#### $\third{- Visuals}$

Visuals should be simple, engaging, and not misleading. 

Statistical considerations: 

* Absolute change and relative change depend on the quantity
* Normalize values for better comparisons
* Means can be misleading (e.g., outliers)
* P-values are only for statistical significance, not proof or indicative of importance

Data Visualization considerations: 

* Aggregate less relevant data
* Make visuals approachable and engaging
* Introduce visualization by name, highlightling the key message
* Focus on the story not on decoding the graph
